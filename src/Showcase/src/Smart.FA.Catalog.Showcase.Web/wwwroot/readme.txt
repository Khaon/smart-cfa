The following folders were imported without any changes from the design system:
/fonts
/js

!!! Important note !!!
/icons folder is mostly identical to the one in the design system, but we added a few blue icons to it which are used in the public website.
/scss folder includes the styles from the design system as well as specific styles for the public website.
/images includes 2 additional files: smart-logo--white-with-padding.svg and Julie-Mayer.jpeg (this last one can be deleted later on).
